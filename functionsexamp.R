#calling a function = name followed by parenthesis, with arguments inside
sqrt(9)
abs(-3)

#autocompleteing functions is a useful IDE feature

# str() = structure
str(3)
str("Santa Barbara")

#another nice feature: syntax highlighting

# Functions can also take multiple arguments
pi
round(pi,0)
round(pi,5)

n_digits <- 2
round(pi, n_digits)

#functions are a great example of encapsulation. Replacing potentially complex
#logic with a very simple name. That makes our code far more readable and
#expressive
